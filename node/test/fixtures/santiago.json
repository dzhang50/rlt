  "body": "At the Viña Vik hotel, in the middle of an eco-conscious wine estate, what’s on the walls matters as much as what’s in your glass.  BELLA VISTA | A suite at Viña Vik celebrates Piero Fornasetti, and includes works by the artist.  PLENTY OF HOTELS display original art; few design guest rooms around works commissioned for the hotel. But that’s the case at VIK, an 11,000-acre wine estate in Millague Valley, about two hours south of Santiago, Chile. Created by Carrie and Alexander Vik, who own upscale hotels in Uruguay, the property includes a vineyard, winery and a new 22-suite, glass-walled inn, Viña Vik. The winery’s entrance plaza, also a sculpture installation. The winery’s entrance plaza, also a sculpture installation. Each of the guest rooms is different. The Azulejo Suite is paved with Portuguese-style tiles depicting a vineyard scene; a pair of velvet ball gowns serve as a headboard. The Norge Suite displays paintings by Norwegian artists and an intricate Orkla rug. Guests can take horseback rides and mountain-biking trips, enjoy the infinity pool and indulge in private wine-tastings and tours of the eco-conscious winery, completed earlier this year. Chilean architect Smiljan Radic gave it a winglike fabric roof that filters natural light. The entry plaza is dotted with a sculpture installation; water cascading over the floor cools the area—as if more cool were needed. From $1,200 a night"
