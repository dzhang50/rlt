  "title": "Paddington Trail Arrives in London",
  "body": "Ever since the impeccably mannered Paddington left the deepest darkest Peru for London in 1958, his adventures have captured the imaginations of kids everywhere. Who can't help but adore the red-booted, marmalade-loving little guy? In celebration of his new movie out November 28th, London itself is being turned into a very bear-y town. The new Paddington Trail will include fifty Paddington statues created by different artists, celebrities, and designers, located at the tiny explorer's favorite sites in the city. Nicole Kidman, Lulu Guinness, and David Beckham are just a few of the big names involved. If you happen to be in London with a few miniature friends of your own, make sure to follow in the footsteps of the famous British-Peruvian resident (all funds from the trail go to to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children)."
