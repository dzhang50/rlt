  "body": "I like my art paired with a bit of travel, and in Costa Rica, that mindset works out well. Yes, San José and its suburbs are replete with galleries and museums that are worth the small entrance fees (i.e. the Jade Museum, the Gold Museum, the National Museum, and the Museum of Costa Rican Art). But to see some of the country’s most mysterious and fascinating art, you’ll need to get out of town. The Museum of the Stone Spheres houses centuries-old curiosities in the Southern Zone, and the home of the country’s main symbol—the oxcart—is a mountain town called Sarchi about an hour from the capital. Galleria Namu in San José has collected the works of indigenous tribes from all over Central America, and for those interested in the classiest kind of culture trip, head down the Inter-American for Monte Azul—an adorable boutique hotel dedicated to art. Museum of Stone Spheres Last year, Costa Rica finally got its act together and opened this Southern Zone museum in the town of Sierpe to honor the country’s most mysterious and fascinating sculptures: the Stone Spheres of Diquís. These 300 nearly perfect spheres that date back to around 1000 A.D. were recently declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nobody knows how they were created, and there’s nothing else like them anywhere in the world. Sarchi Home of the oxcart, a vibrant Costa Rican symbol and coffee transport device, Sarchi is a quaint mountain town populated by artisans. It’s a wonderful place to pick up souvenirs, furniture, jewelry, and miscellaneous adornments. Definitely check out the massive oxcart painted in bright oranges and pinks and presiding over the town square."
